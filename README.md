#Adobe Design to React + SASS

- Open terminal and navigate to root folder "ProSearch Challenge" via 'cd' commands

- Run 'npm install' from project's root directory in terminal to install Express (I have already included the node_modules folder which cotains Express, as it was the only module used for this challenge and it is fairly lightweight, but running 'npm install' will guarantee the latest version)

- Run 'node server.js' from project's root directory in terminal to start server on port 8000

- In your browser, navigate to localhost:8000 to view the page
